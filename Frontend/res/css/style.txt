Based on your provided HTML code, here are a few suggestions for renaming some of the classes and IDs to make them more specific and reduce the chances of conflicts:

    Navbar:
        Consider renaming navbar class to something like my-project-navbar.
        Rename navbarLogo ID to something like my-project-navbar-logo.

    General Main Container:
        Consider renaming #mainView ID to something more specific like #productContainer or #mainProducts.

    Styling for Register Modal:
        Update the styles for the Register Modal to make them more specific to the modal:
            Instead of .modal-content, use .register-modal-content.
            Instead of .modal-header, use .register-modal-header.
            Instead of .modal-title, use .register-modal-title.
            Instead of .modal-body, use .register-modal-body.
            Instead of .modal-footer, use .register-modal-footer.

    Styling for Login Modal:
        Update the styles for the Login Modal to make them more specific to the modal:
            Instead of .modal-content, use .login-modal-content.
            Instead of .modal-header, use .login-modal-header.
            Instead of .modal-title, use .login-modal-title.
            Instead of .modal-body, use .login-modal-body.
            Instead of .modal-footer, use .login-modal-footer.

    Additional Styles for Admin Dashboard:
        Consider adding a prefix to the classes used for the admin dashboard to make them more specific, such as admin-dashboard- or dashboard-.

    Additional Styles for Product Cards:
        Consider adding a prefix to the classes used for product cards, such as product-card- or card-.

Remember, these are just suggestions, and you can adapt them to fit your project's naming conventions and structure. The goal is to make your class and ID names more unique and specific to minimize the chances of conflicts with other stylesheets or frameworks.
