    note for self/team:
     - dynamic loading of pages getting messy
     - script getting long
     - navbar logic getting complicated
     - when I log in content of login-form is saved and when I refresh because of local storage it gets loaded back in

    possible solution:
    - keep navbar same everywhere -> find way to keep navbar but change page below maybe
    - seperate scripts i.e. register.js, login.js
    - keep common functionality in script.js
    - move to MPA, but dynamic loading of content still via scripts
    - create seperate columns/divs in index.html for components such as login
      -> then load those or hide them -> more SPA-affirm --> see modals, icons in nav etc
